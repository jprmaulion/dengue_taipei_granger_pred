# Forecasting dengue cases in Taipei, Taiwan using machine learning methods and Granger causality-based feature engineering

Used XGBoost and artificial neural network (with `lgfbs` as the optimization algorithm) as well as dengue cases lagged 1 week ago to forecast dengue cases in Taipei, Taiwan. I mainly used `pandas` for data processing and `scikit-learn` and `xgboost` libraries for ML modeling.
